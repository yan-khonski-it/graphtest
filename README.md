The program allows you to test a graph. You can download a graph only from txt or graph files.
In other words, the program reads only files with filename extensions "txt" or "graph".
Other files the program does not read.  Also you can save the graph to files "txt" and "graph".

When you work with files "graph", you can save visual representation of the graph. 
It's possible by using serialization.
To work with "txt" files the graph must be correct in the file, or it will not be read.
For more information see "Sample graph".

You can change the graph. You can add vertices and edges and delete edges.
You can find the shorts way from selected vertex to any vertex. To do it you need to select a vertex and to push "Find a way to".
